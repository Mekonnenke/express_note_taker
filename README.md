# Unit 11 Express Note Taker
This express.js note taking application designed to write, save, and delete notes, written to and retrieved from a backend JSON file.
* The application require a command "npm run dev" command to run because I download nodemon package to run the app easly and to make better my coding invironment.



## How to solve this challenge?
The front end already created on the starting code, to connect this with the server I try to breakdown the issued
. Start a server using Express
. Link the HTML to get and post requests in the backend JavaScript
. Write the user's notes to the server's JSON file with unique IDs
. The post method needs to write the note to the JSON file for retrieval
. The get method needs to retrieve notes from the server for viewing
. The delete method needs to locate and delete specific notes from the server
